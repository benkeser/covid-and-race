## Data and code 

This repository contains the data and code needed to reproduce the tables and 
figures included in the paper. The `/Data` directory contains two data files. 
`Data/coviddata.csv` contains county-level information on demographics, underlying
health conditions, social distancing, and COVID-19 cases/deaths as of April 16,
2020. `Data/covid_confirmed_usafacts_416.csv` contains longitudinal data on 
cases occurring over time in each county, which was used in the analysis to 
account for time since first detection in each county. The `Data` directory
also includes state-level shape files [downloaded from the Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.2018.html). 

The `Code/` directory contains all `R` code needed to run the analysis. The main
file is `report.Rmd`, an `R` Markdown file that produces all tables and figures 
reported in the manuscript. This `R` Markdown file `source`s all other `R` scripts
included in the `Code` directory.

## Docker container

The analysis relies on the `R` package `inla`, which has several complex dependent 
packages. For convenience, we built a Docker image described in the `Dockerfile`. 
The image is [available on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/dbenkeser/race-and-covid). With Docker installed, you can download the image via the 
command line as follows. 

``` bash
docker pull dbenkeser/covid-and-race:latest
```

Once downloaded, the image can be run using the `docker run` command. In the container,
results are saved to `/County_COVID/Results`. You may wish to [mount a local directory](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) to the `/County_COVID` directory 
in the container, so that you can open results outside the container. For example,
to run the container with mounted local directory `/path/to/local/directory`, you 
can execute the following at the command line.

``` bash 
docker run -it \
  -v /path/to/local/directory:/County_COVID \
  dbenkeser/race-and-covid:latest
```

The entry point for the container is a bash script. To compile the `R` Markdown document, 
you can execute the following at the command line inside the container. 

``` bash
Rscript -e 'rmarkdown::render("/County_COVID/Code/report.Rmd")'
```

After the report compiles you should see a document `/path/to/local/directory/Results/report.docx` that contains tables from the paper. The folder `/path/to/local/directory/Results/` should also include the figures from the paper as well. Note that in order
to run the analysis, it may be necessary to [increase the memory available to Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#resources).
